# Sorting algorithms
DSA Lab homework 01

Make sure that tests.txt is in the same directory as run.py.

The "tests.txt" file has a number T on the first line. The next T lines contain N(i) and MAX(i) pairs, where i âˆˆ [1, T] is the test number, N is the number of elements that need to be sorted and MAX is the biggest possible value in that array. The program will generate N random numbers and proceed to run each sorting algorithm.
The execution status and time comparison stats will be shown in stdout.

```
python3 ./run.py
``` 

The timeout was set to 75 seconds for all algorithms.
